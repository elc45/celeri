In addition to the point estimate solutions afforded by optimization, `celeri` also provides uncertainty quantification via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paradigm, parameters of interest $\theta$ are given prior distributions, $p(\theta)$ which are then modified to become *posterior* distributions, after taking into account observed data. This method provides an entire probability distribution over the parameters of interest, thereby quantifying the uncertainty around the estimates returned by the model. The model is composed of two parts: the prior, denoted $p(\theta)$, and a *likelihood* $p(x | \theta)$, where $x$ are the observed data. Multiplying these two components together constitutes the *forward model* $p(x|\theta)p(\theta)$, which describes the full data generating process. The MCMC sampler uses this expression to draw from the posterior distribution. 

The geophysical forward model in `celeri` provides maps from geodynamic parameters
to predicted ground velocities at GPS stations.

Mathematically, if $\theta$ denotes the vector of parameters, the predicted
velocity field at all $N$ stations is

$$
v_\text{total}(\theta) \in \mathbb{R}^{2N},
$$

where each station contributes two observed components (east and north).

The state vector $\theta$ is assembled from multiple physical sources
(strain rates, block rotations, Mogi sources, elastic slip, etc.),
each contributing additively to the total expected velocity.

$$
v_\text{total}(\theta) = v_\text{strain} + v_\text{rot} + v_\text{rot,okada} + v_\text{mogi} + v_\text{elastic}.
$$

The velocity components are built from linear maps $O_\text{strain}$, $O_\text{rot}$, $O_\text{rot,okada}$, $O_\text{mogi}$, and $O_\text{kinematic,fault}$ that encode
elastic properties.
These linear maps don't depend on the parameters $\theta$ and are
precomputed by `celeri`.

This decomposes $v_\text{total}(\theta)$ into a sum

$$
v_\text{total}(\theta) = O_\text{strain} \\, \theta_\text{strain} + O_\text{rot} \\, \theta_\text{rot} + \cdots % O_\text{rot,okada} \\, \theta_\text{rot} + O_\text{mogi} \\, \theta_\text{mogi} + v_\text{elastic}.
$$

The $v_\text{elastic}$ component is more elaborate and is described below.

### Uncertainty model

The PyMC uncertainty model turns this deterministic forward map into a probabilistic model
for inference.

#### Observations
At $N$ GPS sites we observe noisy velocities

$$
y_i \in \mathbb{R}^2, \quad i=1,\dots,N.
$$

#### Inference parameters

The PyMC model generates samples of values for the `celeri` parameters $\theta$ that plausibly fit the observed noisy velocities $y_i$.

The model also infers a variance parameter $\sigma^2$.

#### Likelihood

We assume a Gaussian likelihood with shared variance $\sigma^2$:

$$
y_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(v_\text{total, $i$}(\theta), \sigma^2 I_2\right).
$$

Here $y_i$ is the noisy observed datapoint (station), and $v_\text{total, i}(\theta)$ is the forward model prediction for station
$i$, restricted to the horizontal $(x,y)$ directions.

## Geophysical Model Components

### Block strain rates
Each deformable block has a homogeneous 2D strain tensor with 3 parameters. We
use a standard normal prior on the strain parameters after rescaling the
operator columns. The contribution to station velocities is linear:

$$
v_\text{strain} = O_\text{strain} \theta_\text{strain}.
$$

### Block rotations
Each block rotates about the Earth’s center (3 parameters), again with a
standard normal prior after rescaling. The contribution has two parts:
- Station velocities from rigid rotation: $v_\text{rot} = O_\text{rot} \\, \theta_\text{rot}$.
- Slip along faults induced by rotation, mapped through Okada dislocation
  operators $v_\text{rot,okada} = O_\text{rot,okada} \\, \theta_\text{rot}$.

### Mogi sources
Point sources of pressure at fixed locations, with a scalar intensity parameter
each. Again, we use standard normal prior after rescaling. The contribution to
the velocity is again linear:

$$
v_\text{mogi} = O_\text{mogi} \\, \theta_\text{mogi}.
$$

### Elastic slip on faults (TDEs)

On meshed fault segments, we want to model how much of the kinematically
expected slip rate (from rigid block rotations) is actually accommodated
elastically at the fault.

#### Coupling field as a Gaussian process

Define the *coupling ratio field*

$$
c(s) = \frac{v_\text{e,fault}(s)}{v_\text{k,fault}(s)}, \quad s \in \text{fault surface},
$$

where $v_\text{k,fault}(s)$ is the kinematic slip rate implied by block
rotations and $v_\text{e,fault}(s)$ is the actual elastic slip rate at the
fault. The kinematic velocities are computed as a linear function of the
rotation parameters: $v_\text{k,fault} = O_\text{k,fault} \theta_\text{rot}$.

$c(s)$ is given a Gaussian process prior, encoding smoothness along the fault mesh:

$$
c(s) \sim \mathcal{GP}(0, K(s, s')),
$$

with a squared-exponential kernel and constant variance and length scale
hyperparameters. Those hyperparameters are currently fixed, and configured the
same way as in the SQP solver.

We use separate GPs for each fault. At each fault, we compute one GP for the
strike-slip component and one for the dip-slip component, and assume
independence between them.

#### Eigen-expansion (Karhunen–Loève truncation)

In practice, the GP covariance matrix $K \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$ is
computed on the mesh nodes ($M$ = number of fault DOFs). But to avoid very
high-dimensional inference, we use a low-rank approximation of $K$. We perform an
eigen-decomposition

$$
K = U \Lambda U^\top, \quad \Lambda = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_M),
$$

and truncate after $n$ leading eigenmodes (largest $\lambda_i$).
Thus,

$$
c(s) \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i u_i(s),
$$

with coefficients $\alpha_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \lambda_i)$.

This reduces the high-dimensional GP to a low-dimensional expansion that still
captures smooth variation.

#### Bounded transform for constraints

Physically, coupling ratios should fall within plausible limits, e.g.

$$
0 \leq c(s) \leq 1,
$$

or some more general $(\ell, u)$ bounds.

Since the MCMC sampler requires an unconstrained and differentiable probability density, we use smooth transforms of $c(s)$ to enforce these bounds. The way this works is that instead of sampling values of the parameter $c(s)$, we sample from a transformed parameter, and apply the inverse transformation when doing prediction. We use a logistic (sigmoid) if both lower and upper bounds are finite, and a softplus if only a single bound is given. So for instance,

$$
c(s) = \text{expit}(c_\text{unc}(s)) (u - \ell) + \ell,
$$

where $c_\text{unc}$ is the parameter we infer over, before being transformed to the estimated coupling ratio.

#### Resulting elastic slip and station velocities

The elastic slip rate field on the fault surface is then

$$
v_\text{e,fault}(s) = c(s) v_\text{k,fault}(s).
$$

This field is then mapped through a linear operator to yield predicted
velocities at GPS stations:

$$
v_\text{e} = \sum_{\text{faults}}\sum_{\text{ds, ss}} O_\text{tde} v_\text{e,fault}.
$$

#### Alternative direct elastic formulation

Depending on the model configuration, we also support modeling the elastic slip
field as a GP, instead of a coupling ratio. In this case, the elastic slip field
itself** is given a GP prior and eigen-expansion:

$$
v_\text{e,fault}(s) \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i \, u_i(s),
\quad \beta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \lambda_i).
$$

Bounds (if any) are again imposed via softplus or sigmoid transforms, and the
slip field is mapped linearly to station velocities.

Which formulation is used is configured in the model setup, and can differ by
fault or dip/strike component if desired.

## Likelihood and Posterior
The complete likelihood is

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma \sim \text{HalfNormal}(\text{scale}=2) \\
y \sim \mathcal{N}\left(v_\text{total}, \sigma^2 I \right).
\end{gathered}
$$

Since all inequality constraints (e.g. on slip rates or coupling ratios) are
enforced by bounding transforms rather than hard truncation, the posterior
density is smooth and differentiable, so we can use gradient-based MCMC.

The posterior is sampled with **HMC/NUTS** (via PyMC + nutpie). Since there are
highly correlated parameters (e.g. slip on adjacent fault segments), we use the
diagonal plus low-rank mass matrix adaptation scheme from nutpie.


## Output
The posterior predictive mean ${\hat v_\text{total}(\theta)}$ is projected back into
`celeri`’s state vector format for downstream analysis.
Individual draws can be accessed as `estimation.mcmc_draw(chain_idx, draw_idx)`.
